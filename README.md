* [TRRS cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NWFC1HN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) This isnt actually needed.  The havles talk to each other through bluetooth.  I hope the firmware adds a wired capability in the future.

There is some extra keycaps in there each of those is 50 keycaps. My plan is to use 40 of the black and 18 of red.  I also ordered usb-c cables and usb-c to a adapters for this setup but its not really part of the build.
